Let me guess, you had a hard time trying to pronounce my first name, didn’t you? It’s all good, you can call me Sal or Zain, whichever works for you best. But besides my 3 different names, let me tell you a little bit about who I am.

 I have a background in design, business, and programming. Back when I was 17, I started my career as a UI & UX designer. I quickly realized that I had a passion for starting startups. So I co-founded Sha6bu5, the first recipe app in Iraq, and of course designed its UI & UX. Then I moved to the U.S. to participate in a social entrepreneurship semester-long program. After that, I started college majoring in Business Administration. I quickly realized that this field wasn't right for me. So, mid-sophomore year, I made the switch to CS after learning JavaScript on my own and feeling nostalgic about building products. Although I had to finish a 4-year B.Sc. program in 2.5 years, it was the best decision that I have ever made. 

As a CS student, I have learned a little bit about the theory of a wide range of topics such as computer organization, compilers, artificial intelligence, and formal languages, built over 37 coding projects, learned and coded in 12 different programming languages, participated in 2 hackathons, and interned as a software engineer at one of the leading tech companies in the Greater Boston Area, perhaps giving me a decent theoretical & practical foundation in CS. But the most important lesson that I have learned as a CS student is that the more I know, the more I know that I don't know. My knowledge in CS is like a kayak in a giant ocean. I'm eager to keep learning, forever.

### Coding Samples 

If you're an employer, chances are you're here to view my coding samples. So I prepared this section to make your life easier. Unfortunately, there are many projects that I couldn't share publicly for either academic honesty or NDA reasons.

### My CS journey:

| Time         | Event                                                        |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| January 2018 | Switched to CS. Took my first CS class and started coding in Java. This was my first project [GolfTTY](https://github.com/sigmazain/learning_projects/tree/master/GolfTTY) |
| Summer 2018  | Started learning about React & Redux. Later that Fall, I built my portfolio template in React & Redux [React Portfolio](https://github.com/sigmazain/react-simple-portfolio-template) |
| Fall 2018    | The time to immerse myself into Data Structures and Algorithms. Improved my Java skills. Started using programming to find answers to my burning questions such as [Monty Hall Problem](https://github.com/sigmazain/learning_projects/tree/master/monty_hall_problem) |
| Spring 2019  | AI: Learned how to implement AI algorithms such as MiniMax and [CSP](https://github.com/sigmazain/learning_projects/tree/master/AI_CSP)<br/>Computation and Formal Systems: Learned about theory behind computation, how powerful formalization is, and learned C.<br/>Web Development: Besides my passion to learn Go, I took a class in Web Dev. I learned .NET Core and C#. |
| Summer 2019  | I interned at [Cogo Labs](https://cogolabs.com). I wrote thousands of lines of Go code and learned about Docker, Kubernetes, and other awesome tools. Too bad I can't share any of the code I wrote at Cogo. |
| Fall 2019    | Took the following courses:<br />- Programming Language Design and Implementation: 6 projects in total, and wrote code in about 8 different  programming languages, Haskell, Ada, Prolog, Java, OCamel, Python, Go, and C++. <br/>- Computer Organization: writing code mainly in C and assembly. <br/>- Data Mining (graduate level): learned about data mining techniques and algorithms, implemented Apriori & FP-Growth algorithms, and conducted research on food prices in Iraq using time-series analysis tools & techniques. <br/>Besides schools: I wrote mini tools in Go, got more and more comfortable with Unix tools, and used vim/vim keys for most of my coding. |
| Spring 2020  | Took the following courses:<br />- Software Analysis & Improvement (Advanced Compilers): built tools that do analysis & improvement on C code using Python. For example, I wrote code that turns C code into 3 address code then to a control flow graph and runs an iterative analysis algorithm on the code.<br />- Database Management Systems: learned the low-level foundations of database systems. For example, the different methods of indexing and how data is laid out as pages in the memory. We used C++ for to implement parts of the database systems such as writing records in `.csv` to as pages in the memory.<br />- Design & Analysis of Efficient Algorithms: used CLRS Introduction to Algorithms as a guide to learn about dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, graph algorithms, and other misc. topics.<br />- Computer Models & Limitations (Computer Theory): learned about the foundation of formal languages such as regular & context-free languages and Turing machines. Of course, the course wouldn't be complete without asking the question, is P == NP? |
| Summer 2020  | I learned flutter, TypeScript, Vue.js, Electron and other cool stuff on my own. |
| Fall 2020    | I lost my return offer due to COVID-19 after the company had to do its first-ever layoffs and putting hiring on hold  to reduce cash burden. So, I have been building cool stuff for my brother's company and I'm on the job market for SWE positions :) |
| June 2021    | I joined Splunk as a software engineer, the first junior engineer to be hired on the SPL 2 team to work on compilers and static analyzers. |



### Coding Principles/ Dos and Don'ts

- Always READ the documentation. A general mechanic won’t have a better understanding of a BMW car’s engine than a BMW engineer. 

- Always start by planning. While it seems like an unnecessary step, it’s guaranteed to save you time along the way. 

- NEVER EVER become an opinionated developer. After all, programming languages or other tech tools are just utilities that are constantly replaced given how problems change. You are NOT a Go or C developer, you are a developer who uses the best language that solves the problem at hand whether that Go, C, or even OCaml, or a mix of all. 

- DO NOT EVER FALL INTO THE TRAP OF HYPE. Most of the products that were launched today will be deprecated within a year or so. Always use patience and caution before deciding to use a new tool in production, no matter how appealing it looks. 

- Nope, software is never done. If you can’t maintain a product, don’t bother building it. 

- “Clear is better than clever” [Go Proverbs]. 

- “A little copying is better than a little dependency” [Go Proverbs].

- “The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction” [Go Proverbs].

- Do your best to solve your problems using official documentation before looking into StackOverflow. DO NOT use StackOverflow for system-specific details that require official documentation. For example, you SHOULD NOT use StackOverflow as an official source of how Docker Daemon assigns IPs to containers.

- Testing, testing, testing. Would you drive a BMW that hasn't been tested? Software kills too. 

- Refactoring is your annoying friend. While it isn’t always fun to hangout with, this friend will always make your life better by improving your code and helping you avoid bugs. 

- When it comes to technical arguments, things shouldn't get personal. After all, winning isn't about going with person X's or Y's opinion, but it's about going with the most scientific/logical choice that is best for the product. 

- Don’t lead if you are too shy to say no. Saying no is necessary to meet realistic deadlines and focusing on building what matters.
